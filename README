Benu

Operating System Increments for Education and Research
(_Built for _education, _not (normal) _usage)

Simple operating system for demonstration only (academic).
Build through several steps, each bringing something new.
System is "work in progress", improved/extended with (almost) every year.

Name "Benu", besides acronym, represents an Egyptian bird ...

Compilers used:
* for i386 - GNU gcc, GNU ld (GNU Binutils)
* for arm - Sourcery CodeBench Lite Edition for ARM EABI
Tested in QEMU ('qemu-system' package on ubuntu)

IMPORTANT!
==========
If running created system (built from Benu) in emulator other than QEMU, set
standard input and output to vga_text mode -- in conf/config.ini set:
K_INITIAL_STDOUT = vga_text_dev
K_STDOUT = VGA_TXT
U_STDIN = i8042
U_STDOUT = VGA_TXT
U_STDERR = VGA_TXT
(uncomment this lines, comment other with *=COM1)
(Buggy serial port implementation; works on QEMU but not with other emulators)


Please report any bugs (and other problems) on site or via email.

DISCLAIMER
==========
Presented system has (probably) *many* bugs! Many concepts might not be
adequate or good as might be (as are in some "real systems").
*Please* do not use it for any other purpose other than education.
Itâ€™s not tested near enough to be used for anything more.
